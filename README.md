# Frever Animation Asset Pack

Frever is a mobile avatar and content creation platform designed for expressive storytelling through custom 3D characters. Users could create avatars, style outfits, generate short-form video content, and engage in social interactions including chat and user feeds. Videos created with Frever were shared externally and accumulated over **10+ billion views** across platforms.

This open source release contains a curated collection of animation assets designed for use within the **Frever App**.

The assets include various character movements such as emotes, dances, and other expressive actions. These are provided as `.anim` files and, in some cases, as `.fbx` files, allowing easy integration into 3D scenes and runtime animation systems.

These assets are primarily used to animate avatars, enhance storytelling, and create dynamic character-driven content within Frever's ecosystem.
